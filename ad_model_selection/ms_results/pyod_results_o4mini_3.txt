Response for arrhythmia:
{"reason":"The arrhythmia set has high dimensionality (274 features) but very few samples (452), so deep GAN‑based or purely deep models will likely overfit or struggle. An AE1SVM first reduces dimensionality via an autoencoder and then applies a one‑class SVM on the compact representation, providing stronger regularization and robustness on small, high‑dimensional tabular data.","choice":"AE1SVM"}

---------------------
Response for cardio:
{"reason":"Given the relatively small dataset size (1.8k samples) and moderate dimensionality (21 features), a lightweight unsupervised approach that is not overly data‑hungry is preferred. A basic AutoEncoder can learn a compact representation and detect anomalies via reconstruction error without requiring large volumes of data or complex adversarial training. This makes it well‑suited for the “cardio” dataset.", "choice":"AE"}

---------------------
Response for glass:
{"reason":"With only 214 samples and 9 features, complex GAN‐based or deep models risk severe overfitting. An autoencoder provides compact representation learning, and coupling it with a one‐class SVM leverages the SVM’s strength on small datasets for novelty detection. AE1SVM thus balances feature extraction and robust anomaly scoring under limited data.","choice":"AE1SVM"}
AE1SVM
---------------------
Response for ionosphere:
{"reason":"Given the small sample size (351) and moderate dimensionality (33) with no labeled anomalies, a specialized end‑to‑end one‑class formulation like DeepSVDD is well suited. It directly learns a compact feature representation around a hypersphere, is fully unsupervised, and tends to be more stable and effective on limited tabular data than more complex GAN‑based or heavily regularized generative models.","choice":"DeepSVDD"}
DeepSVDD
---------------------
Response for letter:
{"reason":"With a modestly sized dataset (1,600 samples) and a moderate feature dimension (32), a hybrid approach that leverages representation learning while remaining robust to limited data is ideal. AE1SVM first uses an autoencoder to learn a compact feature embedding, then applies a one‑class SVM in that latent space. This combination benefits from the autoencoder’s dimensionality reduction and the one‑class SVM’s strong performance on smaller datasets without requiring extensive GAN training or complex graph structures.","choice":"AE1SVM"}
AE1SVM
---------------------
Response for lympho:
{"reason":"With only 148 samples and 18 dimensions, deep generative or adversarial models risk severe overfitting. A simple autoencoder combined with a one‐class SVM provides robust representation learning while retaining the SVM’s strength on small datasets. AE1SVM is therefore the most suitable choice for reliable anomaly detection here.","choice":"AE1SVM"}
AE1SVM
---------------------
Response for mnist:
{"reason":"Given the moderate sample size (~7.6K) and 100‑dimensional feature space, a lightweight generative model that learns an explicit data distribution and provides efficient anomaly scores is preferable. The Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) can capture the underlying manifold, scale well to this dimensionality, and compute reconstruction‑based anomaly scores without costly per‑sample optimization or dependence on labeled anomalies. Hence, VAE is the best fit.","choice":"VAE"}
VAE

Response for musk:
{"reason":"The musk dataset is moderately sized (3k samples) with high dimensionality (166 features) and lacks abundant labeled anomalies. DeepSVDD is an unsupervised one‐class classification approach that learns a compact representation by enclosing normal data in a minimal hypersphere. It scales well to higher dimensions, does not require adversarial training stability (unlike GAN‐based methods), and often outperforms simple AEs or VAEs under limited data. Thus, DeepSVDD is best suited here.","choice":"DeepSVDD"}
DeepSVDD
---------------------
Response for optdigits:
{"reason":"The optdigits set has a moderate size (5K+) and 64 continuous dimensions, making an encoder-based latent representation beneficial to capture its structure. Follow-up one-class SVM on the learned low‑dim space is known to be effective for anomaly separation with limited data. AE1SVM thus leverages both deep feature learning and a robust one‑class boundary, matching the dataset’s scale and unsupervised anomaly detection needs.","choice":"AE1SVM"}
AE1SVM
---------------------
Response for pendigits:
{"reason":"Given the small-to-medium size (≈7K) and low dimensionality (16) of the Pendigits dataset, a simple autoencoder (AE) is likely to be both effective and efficient. It can learn a compact representation and use reconstruction error for anomaly scoring without the instability or extra complexity of adversarial/GAN‐based methods or the label requirements of deviation networks. AE strikes a good balance between modeling capacity and robustness for this kind of multivariate sensor‐style data.","choice":"AE"}
AE
---------------------
Response for pima:
{"reason":"The Pima dataset is relatively small (768 samples) with only 8 features, so a simple unsupervised model is preferable to avoid overfitting and complex training instability. A standard autoencoder can effectively learn the normal data manifold in low-dimensional space and flag deviations as anomalies without the added complexity of adversarial or probabilistic approaches.","choice":"AE"}
AE
---------------------
Response for satellite:
{"reason":"The satellite dataset is moderately sized (6.4K samples) with 36 continuous features and lacks labeled anomalies, making a pure unsupervised one‑class approach ideal. DeepSVDD directly learns a compact hypersphere in latent space around normal instances, effectively separating outliers without requiring labeled anomalies or complex generative adversarial training. Its focus on boundary tightness in feature space is well suited for this multivariate anomaly detection task.","choice":"DeepSVDD"}
DeepSVDD
---------------------
Response for satimage-2:
{"reason":"The satimage-2 benchmark is a moderate‐sized (5.8 K samples), 36‐dimensional one‐class classification task with only “normal” training data available and a small fraction of anomalies at test time. DeepSVDD is expressly designed for end‐to‐end deep one‐class learning, mapping normal points tightly into a hypersphere in feature space. It avoids the instability of GAN‐based methods on tabular inputs and outperforms basic AEs or VAEs by coupling representation learning directly with the one‐class objective, making it well‐suited for satimage-2.","choice":"DeepSVDD"}
DeepSVDD
---------------------
Response for shuttle:
{"reason":"The shuttle dataset is a moderately large, low-dimensional tabular dataset with rare anomalies and without extensive labeled anomaly samples. DeepSVDD is specifically designed for unsupervised one-class modeling of normal data, learning a compact hypersphere representation that effectively separates anomalies in such settings. Its simplicity and strong performance on similar tabular benchmarks make it the best choice here.","choice":"DeepSVDD"}
DeepSVDD
---------------------
Response for vertebral:
{"reason":"With only 240 samples and 6 dimensions, simpler representation learning combined with a robust boundary method is preferred over heavy GAN‐ or deep one‐class approaches. AE1SVM uses a lightweight autoencoder to capture the structure and then a one‐class SVM to detect anomalies, giving good performance on small, low‐dimensional datasets without overfitting.","choice":"AE1SVM"}

---------------------
Response for vowels:
{"reason":"Given the moderate sample size (1,456) and relatively low feature dimensionality (12), combining representation learning with a robust boundary method is advantageous. AE1SVM uses an autoencoder to learn compact features and a one‐class SVM to define a tight decision boundary around normal data. This two‐stage approach is well-suited to moderate‐sized multivariate data, avoids the instability and data demands of GANs, and does not require labeled anomalies.","choice":"AE1SVM"}

---------------------
Response for wbc:
{"reason":"Given the small sample size (378) and moderate feature dimensionality (30), purely deep/GAN‐based models (ALAD, AnoGAN, MO‐GAAL, SO‐GAAL) risk overfitting and complex training. A simple autoencoder may not be robust enough, while fully unsupervised one‐class methods (e.g. DeepSVDD) may struggle with limited data. The AE1SVM hybrid leverages an autoencoder for compact latent representations and then applies a one‐class SVM, which is known to work well on small to medium tabular datasets by combining feature extraction with a robust one‐class decision boundary. This balance of representation learning and a stable anomaly boundary makes AE1SVM the best fit.","choice":"AE1SVM"}
