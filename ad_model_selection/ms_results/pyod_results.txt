Response for arrhythmia:
{
  "reason": "The arrhythmia dataset is very small (452 instances) but extremely high‑dimensional (274 features).  GAN‑based approaches (ALAD, AnoGAN, MO‑GAAL, SO‑GAAL) and graph / deep network methods (LUNAR, DevNet) generally require thousands of samples to train stably; with only a few hundred points they are prone to mode collapse or severe overfitting.  A plain AutoEncoder or VAE can perform dimensionality reduction but, with so little data, their reconstruction error alone often lacks discrimination power.  DeepSVDD similarly trains a deep net end‑to‑end and is likely to overfit.  AE1SVM first compresses the data with a small autoencoder and then applies a kernel one‑class SVM in the learned low‑dimensional space.  The AE can be kept very shallow to avoid overfitting, while the one‑class SVM is well known to work well on small datasets and can capture non‑linear boundaries in the compressed space.  This hybrid makes the best use of limited samples while mitigating the curse of dimensionality, so it is the most compatible with the dataset’s characteristics.",

Response for cardio:
{
  "reason": "The cardio dataset is small‑to‑moderate in size (1 831 samples) and only 21‑dimensional, so very deep or GAN‑based models such as ALAD, AnoGAN, MO‑GAAL or SO‑GAAL are likely to train unstably or over‑fit. DevNet needs a few labelled anomalies, which are typically not available for this dataset. LUNAR is graph‑based and can work, but its gain over simpler approaches on low‑dimensional, small datasets is usually limited. \n\nAmong the remaining purely unsupervised, light‑weight neural methods, DeepSVDD is well suited: it trains a compact network that pulls normal data into a small hypersphere, giving sharp decision boundaries while requiring far fewer samples than GANs or VAEs. Compared with a plain AutoEncoder or AE+OC‑SVM, DeepSVDD avoids an extra model (SVM) and hyper‑parameter search and has been shown in empirical studies (including on ODDS tabular datasets like cardio) to outperform basic AE and VAE baselines. Therefore, DeepSVDD is the most compatible and likely highest‑performing choice for anomaly detection on this dataset.",

Response for glass:
{
  "reason": "The glass dataset is very small (214 samples) and low‑dimensional (9 features). GAN‑based methods (ALAD, AnoGAN, MO‑GAAL, SO‑GAAL) and other deep architectures (DevNet, LUNAR) typically need far more data to train stably. DeepSVDD and plain AE/VAE also involve training neural networks end‑to‑end and can easily overfit with so few points. AE1SVM, however, combines a light auto‑encoder (which can be kept shallow for such a small dataset) with a classical one‑class SVM, a model known to work well on small, low‑dimensional data. The SVM provides a strong analytic boundary without requiring large amounts of training data, while the AE can still capture any mild nonlinear structure. This balance makes AE1SVM the most suitable and likely highest‑performing option for anomaly detection on this dataset.",

Response for ionosphere:
{
  "reason": "The ionosphere dataset is small (351 instances) and only moderately high‑dimensional (33 features).  GAN‑based methods such as ALAD, AnoGAN, MO‑GAAL and SO‑GAAL generally require far larger datasets to train their generator–discriminator pairs stably, so they are prone to overfitting and mode collapse here.  Variational approaches (VAE) and plain auto‑encoders (AE) can work on small data, but without an explicit one‑class objective they often reconstruct both normal and abnormal points equally well, reducing anomaly separability.  AE1SVM improves on AE but still splits the learning into two independent stages and relies on kernel SVM scalability.\n\nDeepSVDD, in contrast, trains a lightweight neural network end‑to‑end to map normal data into a minimal‑volume hypersphere, directly optimising an anomaly‑specific objective while remaining parameter‑efficient.  It has been shown to work well on tabular UCI datasets of comparable size (including ionosphere) and does not need labelled anomalies or large sample sizes.  Thus, among the available options, DeepSVDD is the most compatible with the dataset’s size, dimensionality and fully unsupervised setting, and is therefore the model most likely to achieve the best anomaly‑detection performance.",

Response for letter:

  "reason": "The dataset is of moderate size (1600 samples) and moderate dimensionality (32 features). GAN‑based methods (ALAD, AnoGAN, MO‑GAAL, SO‑GAAL) generally need larger datasets and are harder to train stably in low‑sample regimes, so they are less suitable here. Plain autoencoders (AE/VAE) are simple but may not provide the tight decision boundary needed for accurate one‑class anomaly detection, while AE1SVM adds an extra SVM stage that can overfit or be sensitive to kernel choices. DeepSVDD is purpose‑built for one‑class, fully unsupervised anomaly detection; it directly learns a compact representation that encloses the normal data in a hypersphere, has been shown to work well on small‑to‑medium tabular datasets (including the “letter” dataset in its original paper), and does not require adversarial training. Hence, DeepSVDD is the most compatible and likely to deliver the best performance for this dataset.",

Response for lympho:
{
  "reason": "The dataset is very small (148 samples, 18 features). GAN‑based approaches (ALAD, AnoGAN, MO‑GAAL, SO‑GAAL) and other heavily parameterized deep models (DevNet, LUNAR) generally require much larger datasets to train reliably; on so few points they are prone to mode collapse or severe over‑fitting. A plain AutoEncoder or VAE would train, but their reconstruction‑error thresholding alone is often unstable on such limited data. AE1SVM first learns a light autoencoder (which can be kept shallow to avoid over‑fitting) to obtain a compact representation, then applies a one‑class SVM—an algorithm that is well‑established for small‑sample anomaly detection. The combination leverages the non‑linear feature learning of the AE while relying on the robust, kernel‑based boundary of the SVM to detect outliers, making it well‑suited to a small, low‑dimensional dataset like “lympho”. Therefore, AE1SVM is the most appropriate choice.",

Response for mnist:
{
  "reason": "The dataset is a variant of MNIST (image‑like data that has already been embedded into a 100‑dimensional vector space).  The sample size (≈7.6 k) is big enough to train a small neural network, but not large enough to make training a full GAN (ALAD, AnoGAN, GAAL variants) stable and reliable.  Among the purely unsupervised, non‑GAN alternatives, DeepSVDD is specifically designed for one‑class / anomaly detection on image data and was originally validated on MNIST, where it consistently outperformed standard auto‑encoders, VAEs and GAN‑based approaches while being much easier to optimise.  It requires no labelled anomalies (unlike DevNet), scales well to the given data size, and is computationally lighter than graph‑based LUNAR or kernel‑based AE1SVM.  Therefore it is the most compatible and likely to give the best performance on this dataset.",

Response for optdigits:

  "reason": "The dataset consists of only 5 216 examples of low‑resolution (8×8=64‑dimensional) digit images.

It needs no labelled anomalies (unlike DevNet) and is simpler and more data‑efficient than the GAN‑based methods, making it the most suitable choice here.",

This setting does not require the heavy capacity and training instability risks of GAN‑based approaches (ALAD, AnoGAN, MO‑GAAL, SO‑GAAL) and does not fully exploit graph–neighbourhood structures targeted by LUNAR. A straightforward auto‑encoder can learn a compact representation, but adding a one‑class SVM on the learned latent space (AE1SVM) provides a strong, well‑established statistical boundary around the normal class, which typically yields higher precision–recall on tabular, low‑dimension data. Hence, AE1SVM balances representation learning and a robust boundary model and is likely to outperform the other candidates on this dataset.",

DeepSVDD, DevNet and LUNAR employ deeper networks whose benefit over simpler models diminishes when the feature space is only 8‑D and data are scarce.  In contrast, an Autoencoder‑based One‑Class SVM (AE1SVM) first learns a compact non‑linear representation with a shallow AE (which can be trained reliably even on small data) and then applies a one‑class SVM, a method that is well‑known to work effectively on low‑dimensional tabular data and small sample sizes.  This combination tends to outperform a plain AE while remaining far less data‑hungry and easier to regularise than GAN‑type approaches, making AE1SVM the most compatible and likely best‑performing choice for anomaly detection on the Pima dataset.",

Response for satellite:
{
  "reason": "The Satellite dataset is a medium‑sized (≈6.4K samples) tabular data set with 36 continuous features and only a very small fraction of true anomalies.

It builds a k‑NN graph and leverages a lightweight GNN to learn representations that unify several local‑outlier criteria, giving it the ability to adapt to local density differences while remaining data‑efficient. Prior empirical studies on ODDS/ODDS+ tabular benchmarks (which include the Satellite data) show LUNAR achieving higher ROC‑AUC and PR‑AUC than Autoencoders, DeepSVDD, and VAE on this very dataset. Models such as DevNet need labelled anomalies, and AE1SVM/DeepSVDD often underperform LUNAR on medium‑dimensional tabular data.\n\nTherefore, LUNAR is the most compatible and empirically strong choice for anomaly detection on the Satellite dataset.",

LUNAR builds exactly on this idea: it first computes several local outlier scores, constructs a similarity graph and then refines those scores with a graph neural network. This gives it the advantages of LOF‑style locality while adding a learnable, representation‑aware refinement. It is fully unsupervised, does not need the large data volumes or training instability associated with GAN‑based models, and in the original paper LUNAR achieved near‑perfect AUROC on Satimage‑2, outperforming AE, VAE, DeepSVDD, DevNet and the GAN variants.
