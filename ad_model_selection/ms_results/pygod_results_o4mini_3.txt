Response for weibo:
{"reason":"The weibo dataset has a large-scale attributed graph with high-dimensional node features (400 dims) and dense connectivity. Contrastive Attributed Network Anomaly Detection (CONAD) excels in learning robust representations by contrasting normal and perturbed subgraphs, effectively capturing both structure and feature anomalies in large graphs. Its contrastive learning framework scales well to high-dimensional attributes and large edge counts, making it well-suited for this weibo dataset.","choice":"CONAD"}

Response for reddit:
{"reason":"The reddit graph is a medium‐scale attributed network where anomalies often arise from mismatches between node features and local/global structure. CONAD’s contrastive learning framework explicitly models such feature–structure relationships and has been shown to outperform earlier autoencoder‐ or GAN‐based methods (e.g., DOMINANT, GAAN) on similar datasets. It scales efficiently to ~10k nodes and captures nuanced discrepancies for robust anomaly detection.","choice":"CONAD"}

Response for disney:
{"reason":"The disney dataset is small (124 nodes, 335 edges) with low average degree (2.7) but a moderate number of attributes (28). DOMINANT employs a dual autoencoder to jointly reconstruct both structure and attribute information, making it robust for detecting anomalies when structural signals are sparse yet rich attribute signals exist. Its simpler architecture also avoids overfitting issues common in heavier models (e.g., GAN-based) on small graphs.","choice":"DOMINANT"}

Response for books:
{"reason":"Given the books dataset’s moderate size and sparsity (avg degree 2.6) along with 21 node features, a dual‐autoencoder approach that separately models structure and attributes is best suited. AnomalyDAE’s two‐stream design—one autoencoder for adjacency and one for attributes—allows it to reconstruct and score both structural and feature anomalies effectively, even on sparse graphs, yielding robust detection performance.","choice":"AnomalyDAE"}

Response for enron:
{"reason":"Given the medium‐sized Enron graph (∼13k nodes, ∼177k edges) with a modest attribute dimensionality (18), Contrastive Attributed Network Anomaly Detection (CONAD) stands out. Its contrastive learning framework effectively captures both structural and attribute irregularities without heavy adversarial training, scales well to this graph size, and has been shown to outperform many earlier deep autoencoder or GAN‐based approaches on similar tasks.","choice":"CONAD"}
