Response for weibo:
{"reason":"The weibo graph is large (8k nodes, 400k edges) with high-dimensional node attributes (400 features). AnomalyDAE’s dual autoencoder design jointly reconstructs both structural and attribute information, which makes it particularly effective at capturing subtle deviations in both domains on large attributed networks. Its demonstrated scalability and strong detection performance on benchmarks with similar characteristics make it the best choice for this dataset.","choice":"AnomalyDAE"}

Response for reddit:
{"reason":"CONAD’s contrastive learning framework effectively captures discrepancies between structural and attribute patterns, making it well-suited for detecting subtle anomalies in a moderately sized, feature-rich graph like reddit. Its ability to leverage both global and local views of the network scales well to ~11K nodes and 64-dimensional features, offering robust performance over other embedding or GAN-based methods.","choice":"CONAD"}

Response for disney:
{"reason":"Given the small, sparse network (124 nodes, 335 edges, avg degree ~2.7) with rich node attributes (28 features), a model that jointly reconstructs both structure and attributes in a simple autoencoder framework is most appropriate. DOMINANT is specifically designed for deep anomaly detection on attributed networks, efficiently capturing discrepancies in both topology and features, and has proven robustness on smaller graphs.","choice":"DOMINANT"}

Response for books:
{"reason":"The books dataset is relatively small and sparse (average degree 2.6) but comes with 21 node features, so effective anomaly detection requires jointly leveraging both structure and attributes. AnomalyDAE’s dual-autoencoder design explicitly reconstructs adjacency and feature matrices, making it well-suited to sparse graphs where attribute information can compensate for limited connectivity while still capturing structural anomalies. This balanced approach should yield strong detection performance on the books data.","choice":"AnomalyDAE"}

Response for enron:
{"reason":"The DOMINANT model is specifically designed for deep anomaly detection on attributed networks by jointly reconstructing both structure and node attributes. It has been empirically validated on the Enron email dataset (which matches this graph’s size and feature dimensions) and scales well to a few tens of thousands of nodes. Its reconstruction‐error based scoring effectively highlights anomalous nodes in communication networks like Enron.","choice":"DOMINANT"}
